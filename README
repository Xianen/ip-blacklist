This project exists to keep a master list of IPs to block from web servers. The
IPs are a list of hosting services around the world that are known to host
various bots, spiders, scrapers, etc.


INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
=========================

To use it, copy it to your Apache http's conf.d dir:
<ServerRoot>/conf.d/ip_blacklist.conf

Ensure that it is included from the httpd.conf file. Look for the following
line:

Include conf.d/*.conf

If it isn't present, you can explicitly include this file with the following
line:

Include conf.d/ip_blacklist.conf

This file applies the blacklisted IPs to every single server request, regardless
of what location the user agent requests. It will also override the access rules
defined in directives such as <Directory> and <Files>. The following Apache
documentation is helpful to understand how these directives are merged and
override each other.

http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/sections.html#mergin

You might also include this file from an .htaccess file, but this is not quite
as efficient as having httpd load the configuration on startup because it will
read the .htaccess file every time a request is made to the server. The tradeoff
is that the server must be restarted each time the blacklist is updated, but
updates normally don't happen too frequently.
