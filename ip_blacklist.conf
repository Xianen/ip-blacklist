#
# This file is comprised of blacklisted IPs based on honeypot site visits by various bots.
#
#
# INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
#
# To use it, copy it to your Apache http's conf.d dir:
# <ServerRoot>/conf.d/ip_blacklist.conf
#
# Ensure that it is included from the httpd.conf file. Look for the following line:
# Include conf.d/*.conf
#
# If it isn't present, you can explicitly include this file with the following line:
# Include conf.d/ip_blacklist.conf
#
# This file applies the blacklisted IPs to every single server request, regardless of what
# location the user agent requests. It will also override the access rules defined in
# directives such as <Directory> and <Files>. The following Apache documentation is helpful
# to understand how these directives are merged and override each other.
# http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/sections.html#mergin
#
# You might also include this file from an .htaccess file, but this is not quite as
# efficient as having httpd load the configuration on startup because it will read the
# .htaccess file every time a request is made to the server.
